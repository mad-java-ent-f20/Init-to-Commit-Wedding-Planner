# Weekly Reflection

Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles. 

### Week 1

9.8.20 - 7 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Chose a project goal
 * Created this repository 
 * Wrote the problem statement
 * Started documenting the project plan
 * Began listing technologies and how they fit in this project

I'm struggling with the creative side to the project as I don't want to add too little or too much at this point.


### Week 2

 * Researched more on just ideas on what to add to project
 * Created rough draft of user stories

 Struggling getting all the project work done with also hw from other classes and work.

 ### Week 3

 * Added more to project and journal logs
 * Creating wire frames of screen design (might need to re-think some pages....rough draft)

 Thought about adding wedding registry to the app.  Might add later if time permits as it would be a great add on.
